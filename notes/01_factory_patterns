CHAPTER 1 - THE FACTORY PATTERNS
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Gang Of Four

    - The patterns here were popularized by the book 'Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable 
        Object-Oriented Software' by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.


    - The GoF defined 23 original design patterns:

        Creational:
          1. Factory Method
          2. Abstract Factory
          3. Builder
          4. Prototype
          5. Singleton

        Structural:
          6. Adapter
          7. Decorator
          8. Bridge
          9. Facade
          10. Flyweight
          11. Composite
          12. Proxy

        Behavioral:
          13. Chain of Responsibility
          14. Command
          15. Observer
          16. State
          17. Interpreter
          18. Strategy
          19. Memento
          20. Iterator
          21. Template
          22. Mediator
          23. Visitor



- Creational Design Patterns

    - Creational design patterns deal with different aspects of object creation.  Their goal is to 
        provide better alternatives for situations where direct object creation ('__init__()' calls)
        is not convenient.



- Factory Patterns

    - In the factory design pattern, a client asks for an object without knowing which class is used
        to generate it.  This simplifies the object creation process, because it is easier to track
        which objects are created if this is done through a central function.


    - A factory reduces complexity by decoupling the code that creates an object from the code that
        uses it.


    - Factories typically come in 2 forms:

        1. Factory Method   = a method that returns a different object per input parameter

        2. Abstract Factory = a group of factory methods used to create a family of related objects



- The Factory Method Pattern

    - The factory method is based on a single function written to handle our object creation task.  
        We execute it, passing a parameter that provides information about what we want, and as a result,
        the desired object is created.  We are not required to know how the resulting object is
        implemented.


    - If you realize you cannot track the objects created in your application because the code that
        creates them is in many different places, consider using the factory method pattern.



- Factory Method Example

    - In this example, we'll create a client that can read both XML and JSON files.


        # movies.json
        [
          {"title":"After Dark in Central Park",
           "year":1900, 
           "director":null, "cast":null, "genre":null},
          {"title":"Boarding School Girls' Pajama Parade",
           "year":1900, 
           "director":null, "cast":null, "genre":null},
          {"title":"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Parad",
           "year":1900, 
           "director":null, "cast":null, "genre":null}
        ]


        # persons.xml
        <persons>
          <person> 
            <firstName>Patty</firstName> 
            <lastName>Liar</lastName> 
            <age>20</age> 
            <address> 
              <streetAddress>18 2nd Street</streetAddress> 
              <city>New York</city> 
              <state>NY</state> 
              <postalCode>10021</postalCode> 
            </address> 
            <phoneNumbers> 
              <phoneNumber type="home">212 555-1234</phoneNumber> 
              <phoneNumber type="mobile">001 452-8819</phoneNumber> 
            </phoneNumbers> 
            <gender> 
              <type>female</type> 
            </gender> 
          </person> 
        </persons>


    - Here is the extractor for JSON data.  Note that the 'property' decorator is used to make
        'parsed_data()' appear as a normal attribute instead of a method.

        import json

        class JsonDataExtractor:
            def __init__(self, filepath):
                self.data = dict()
                with open(filepath, mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                    self.data = json.load(f)

            @property
            def parsed_data(self):
                return self.data


    - Here is the extractor for XML data.

        import xml.etree.ElementTree as etree

        class XmlDataExtractor:
            def __init__(self, filepath):
                self.tree = etree.parse(filepath)

            @property
            def parsed_data(self):
                return self.tree


    - Here, the 'dataextraction_factory()' function is a factory method.  It returns the correct 
        extractor based on the file extension.


        def data_extraction_factory(filepath):
            if filepath.endswith('json'):
                extractor = JsonDataExtractor
            elif filepath.endswith('xml'):
                extractor = XmlDataExtractor
            else:
                raise ValueError('Cannot extract data from {}'.format(filepath))
            return extractor(filepath)


        def extract_data_from(filepath):
            factory_obj = None
            try:
                factory_obj = data_extraction_factory(filepath)
            except ValueError as e:
                print(e)
            return factory_obj


        def main():
            # Process json file
            json_factory = extract_data_from('movies.json')
            json_data = json_factory.parsed_data

            print(f'Found: {len(json_data)} movies')
            for movie in json_data:
                print(f"Title: {movie['title']}")
                year = movie['year']
                if year:
                    print(f"Year: {year}")
                director = movie['director']
                if director:
                    print(f"Director: {director}")
                genre = movie['genre']
                if genre:
                    print(f"Genre: {genre}")
                print()


            # Process xml file
            xml_factory = extract_data_from('persons.xml')
            xml_data = xml_factory.parsed_data

            liars = xml_data.findall(f".//person[lastName='Liar']")
            print(f'found: {len(liars)} persons')
            for liar in liars:
                firstname = liar.find('firstName').text
                print(f'first name: {firstname}')
                lastname = liar.find('lastName').text
                print(f'last name: {lastname}')
                [print(f"phone number ({p.attrib['type']}):", p.text) 
                for p in liar.find('phoneNumbers')]
                print()


            # Trying to process other file types raises exception
            sqllite_factory = extract_data_from('person.sq3')



- The Abstract Factory Pattern

    - The abstract factory design pattern is a generalization of the factory method.  Basically, an
        abstract factory is a group of factory methods, where each factory method is responsible
        for generating a different kind of object.


    - The 'factory_boy' package provides an abstract factory for creating Django models in tests.  It
        is used for creating instances of models that support test-specific attributes.


    - Like the factory method pattern, the abstract factory makes tracking object creation easier, it
        decouples object creation from object usage, and it gives us the potential to improve the memory
        usage and performance of our application.  If we find out that our application requires many
        factory methods, which it makes sense to combine to create a family of objects, we end up with
        an abstract factory.


    - The classic example of an abstract factory is to change the look and feel of an application 
        (for example, Apple-like, Windows-like, etc.) for the user while the application is in use, 
        without having to terminate it and start again.



- Abstract Factory Example

    - Here, we start with a kid's game called 'FrogWorld'.  The main hero is a frog who enjoys eating
        bugs.

        class Frog:
            def __init__(self, name):
                self.name = name

            def __str__(self):
                return self.name

            def interact_with(self, obstacle):
                act = obstacle.action()
                msg = f'{self} the Frog encounters {obstacle} and {act}!'
                print(msg)


    - There can be many different kinds of obstacles, but for our example, an obstacle can only be a
        bug.  When the frog encounters a bug, only one action is supported.  It eats it.

        class Bug:
            def __str__(self):
                return 'a bug'

            def action(self):
                return 'eats it'


    - The 'FrogWorld' class is an abstract factory.  Its main responsibilities are creating the main
        character and obstacles in the game.  It keeps its creation methods ('make_character' and
        'make_obstacle') separate and generic allows us to change the factory dynamically.

      In a statically typed language, the abstract factory would be an abstract class or interface
        with empty methods.  In Python, this is not required, because the types are checked at runtime.


        class FrogWorld:
            def __init__(self, name):
                print(self)
                self.player_name = name

            def __str__(self):
                return '\n\n\t------ Frog World -------'

            def make_character(self):
                return Frog(self.player_name)

            def make_obstacle(self):
                return Bug()


    - The 'WizardWorld' game is very similar to FrogWorld.  The only difference is that the wizard
        battles monsters like 'orks' instead of eating bugs.

        class Wizard:
            def __init__(self, name):
                self.name = name

            def __str__(self):
                return self.name

            def interact_with(self, obstacle):
                act = obstacle.action()
                msg = f'{self} the Wizard battles against {obstacle} and {act}!'
                print(msg)


        class Ork:
            def __str__(self):
                return 'an evil ork'

            def action(self):
                return 'kills it'


        class WizardWorld:
            def __init__(self, name):
                print(self)
                self.player_name = name

            def __str__(self):
                return '\n\n\t------ Wizard World -------'

            def make_character(self):
                return Wizard(self.player_name)

            def make_obstacle(self):
                return Ork()


    - The 'GameEnvironment' class is the main entry point of our game.  It accepts the factory as an
        input and uses it to create the world of the game.  

        class GameEnvironment:
            def __init__(self, factory):
                self.hero = factory.make_character()
                self.obstacle = factory.make_obstacle()

            def play(self):
                self.hero.interact_with(self.obstacle)


    - Now, we'll actually play the game.  We ask the user for their age, and if they're under 18, we
        launch the FrogWorld game, and if they're 18+, we launch the WizardWorld game.

        def validate_age(name):
            try:
                age = input(f'Welcome {name}. How old are you? ')
                age = int(age)
            except ValueError as err:
                print(f"Age {age} is invalid, please try again...")
                return (False, age)
            return (True, age)


        def main():
            name = input("Hello.  What's your name? ")
            valid_input = False
            while not valid_input:
                valid_input, age = validate_age(name)
            game = FrogWorld if age < 18 else WizardWorld
            environment = GameEnvironment(game(name))
            environment.play()
